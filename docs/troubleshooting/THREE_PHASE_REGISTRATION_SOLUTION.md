# Three-Phase Registration Solution - Complete

## ✅ Problem Resolved: Store Registration Image Upload Fixed

**Issue**: Image upload failed during registration because the Store entity didn't exist yet when trying to upload to `/stores/upload-images` API.

**Root Cause**: The upload API requires `storeService.getStoreByUser()` to return an existing store, but during registration, no store exists yet.

## 🚀 Solution Implemented: Three-Phase Registration Flow

### **Phase 1: Basic Store Registration**
- **Focus**: Register store with required basic information only
- **No image upload** during this phase
- **Store gets created** and saved to database
- **Redirects to**: `/stores/setup-images`

### **Phase 2: Image Setup (Optional)**
- **Dedicated page**: `/stores/setup-images` 
- **Store now exists** → Upload API works perfectly
- **Advanced upload UI** with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Two options**: Complete setup or Skip for later

### **Phase 3: Final Completion**
- **Redirect to**: `/stores/my-store`
- **Success message** displayed
- **Images can be added later** via edit mode

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **1. Updated Registration Form**
- **Removed image upload UI** from registration
- **Added info card** explaining images will be added next
- **Simplified registration** focuses on basic store info only

```html
<!-- Info Card for Registration -->
<div class="info-card">
    <div class="info-icon">📷</div>
    <div class="info-content">
        <h4>이미지 업로드</h4>
        <p>스토어 등록 완료 후 다음 단계에서 이미지를 추가할 수 있습니다.</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

### **2. Updated Registration Controller**
- **Modified redirect** from `/stores/my-store` to `/stores/setup-images`
- **Store creation successful** → immediate redirect to image setup

```java
@PostMapping("/register")
public String registerStore(...) {
    // Create store with basic info
    storeService.registerStore(request, userUuid);
    // Redirect to image setup instead of my-store
    return "redirect:/stores/setup-images";
}
```

### **3. New Image Setup Endpoints**
- **`GET /stores/setup-images`** - Shows image upload page
- **`POST /stores/setup-images/complete`** - Completes setup
- **`POST /stores/setup-images/skip`** - Skips image upload

```java
@GetMapping("/setup-images")
public String showImageSetup(Model model, @AuthenticationPrincipal UserDetailsImpl userDetails) {
    // Verify store exists, show upload page
    return "store/setup-images";
}
```

### **4. Professional Image Setup Page**
- **Progress indicator** showing registration steps
- **Congratulations message** with store name
- **Advanced upload areas** for main and gallery images
- **Tips and guidance** for users
- **Skip/Complete buttons** for flexible flow
