# Product Domain

## Overview
The product domain manages product listings, creation, and collaboration-related product features within the platform.

## Domain Model
- **Product**: `Product.java` - Core product entity

## Repository
Following the consistent three-layer pattern:
- **Domain Interface**: `ProductRepository` - Business logic interface
- **JPA Interface**: `ProductJpaRepository` - Data access interface (extends JpaRepository)
- **Implementation**: `ProductRepositoryImpl` - Concrete implementation

## Controllers
- `ProductController.java` - Product management and CRUD operations

## Product Features

### Product Management
- **Creation**: Users can create product listings
- **Management**: Edit, update, and delete products
- **Listing**: Browse and search available products
- **Details**: Detailed product information and specifications

### Collaboration Integration
- **Product-Specific Collaborations**: Products can be the basis for collaboration requests
- **Collaboration Products**: Special handling for products in active collaborations
- **Business Matching**: Products used for business-user matching algorithms

## Templates and UI
- `products/create.html` - Product creation form
- `products/detail.html` - Product detail view
- `products/list.html` - Product listing and browsing

## Product Workflow
1. **Creation**: User creates product with details and specifications
2. **Listing**: Product appears in browse/search results
3. **Discovery**: Other users find products through exploration
4. **Collaboration**: Products can trigger collaboration requests
5. **Management**: Ongoing product updates and maintenance

## Integration Points
- **User Domain**: Product ownership and creation permissions
- **Collaboration Domain**: Products as collaboration subjects
- **Search/Discovery**: Product browsing and matching features

## API Endpoints
- Product CRUD operations
- Product listing and search
- Product detail retrieval
- (Detailed endpoint documentation to be added as implemented)

## Business Logic
- **Ownership**: Products tied to creating users
- **Collaboration Matching**: Products used in business matching algorithms
- **Search and Discovery**: Product categorization and search features
- **Status Management**: Product availability and collaboration status

## Data Model
- **UUID Primary Keys**: Consistent with platform architecture
- **User Association**: Products linked to creating users
- **Metadata**: Product specifications, descriptions, and details
- **Collaboration Flags**: Integration with collaboration system

## Security Considerations
- **Ownership Validation**: Users can only modify their own products
- **Access Control**: Product visibility and access permissions
- **Input Validation**: Product data validation and sanitization
