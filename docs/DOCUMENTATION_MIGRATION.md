- Domain-specific business logic
- Controller and endpoint details
- Integration patterns between domains
- Workflow descriptions
- Technical implementation details

### What Was Enhanced
- Clear navigation between documents
- Domain-specific deep dives
- Cross-references and integration points
- Structured information hierarchy

## Benefits for New Contributors

### Improved Navigation
- Quick overview in CLAUDE.md
- Domain-specific deep dives in dedicated files
- Clear linking between related concepts
- Logical information hierarchy

### Better Comprehension
- Separation of concerns in documentation
- Domain-driven organization
- Focused content per business area
- Reduced cognitive load

### Easier Maintenance
- Domain experts can maintain their specific documentation
- Changes isolated to relevant domains
- Consistent structure across all domain files
- Clear ownership of documentation sections

## File Organization
```
/docs/
├── DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION.md (this file)
└── domains/
    ├── auth/README.md
    ├── user/README.md
    ├── collaboration/README.md
    ├── chat/README.md
    ├── product/README.md
    └── notification/README.md

CLAUDE.md (project root - main navigation)
```

## Cross-Reference Map
Each domain README includes:
- Overview and purpose
- Domain models and repositories
- Controllers and endpoints
- Integration points with other domains
- Workflows and business logic
- Technical implementation details

CLAUDE.md provides quick summaries and links to detailed domain documentation.

## Migration Complete ✅
